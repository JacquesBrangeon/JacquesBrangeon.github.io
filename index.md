# About This Page

This portfolio will detail any and all appropriate software work that I have completed and am currently working on. I will aim to expand it whenever applicable. As of right now, this work will be limited to projects that I have worked on with the use of Unity Learn's free online tools and assests.

My first journey into Unity, this is a 3D microgame that taught me the basics of the Unity software. These basics involved 3D rendering, camera setup, and C# scripting. It is as simple as games come, with a clear goal, obstacles, and an ending that quits the program.

The entire project was completed in roughly 6 hours, which should be the first insight into my work pace. Given the state of the world at the time of writing (April 2020), I hope to continue to work on this project to add my own small adjustments with the amount of free time I currently find myself having.

Links to code and game download to be added.
