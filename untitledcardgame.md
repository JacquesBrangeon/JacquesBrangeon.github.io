title: Untitled Card Game
---

This card game has been my first adventure into Unity without the use of Unity Learn, after I had an idea for an application that I really wanted to develop. I had just picked up a new mobile card game (Shadowverse), and the new professional league season of HiRez Studios' SMITE had just kicked off. I decided that I wanted to try my hand (like a hand of cards, get it?) at creating a multiplayer, turn-based, strategy card game.

To get started, I had a huge amount of assistance from M. S. Farzan on YouTube, who has a fantastic series of videos on how to build a basic multiplayer card game, which I was able to follow up until the point at which my view for this game diverged from his work.

This project has been one of my favourite things to work on, ever. I've learned so many different things, and been able to properly throw myself at it, and to see the product of that work is, and always will be, one of my favourite things about programming. The best part is that this little game still has so far to go to be perfect, and maybe never will be, but I get to keep working on it!

The next steps after this demo "goes up" will likely be for me to work on the look and aesthetic appeal of the game; something that has never been my strong point, but will be fun to learn more about.

It must be noted that all card art in this game has made use of SMITE assets that are the property of HiRez Studios. I have made multiple attempts to reach out to the legal team to clarify that I have the right to use these in a game that is not intended for the production of revenue, but I am yet to get a response.

If you would like to try out this game, I will soon be writing a guide for setting it up and the repository is [here](https://github.com/JacquesBrangeon/JacquesBrangeon.github.io/tree/master/untitled_card_game). There are still a few bugs right now, such as the mana system, and the game still looks like garbage, but these are thing I hope to fix in the near future.
