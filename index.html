<h1>Jacques Brangeon - Online Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Draft portfolio for work by Jacques Brangeon</p>
  <p>This portfolio will detail any and all appropriate software work that I have completed and am currently working on. I will aim to 
    expand it whenever applicable. As of right now, this work will be limited to projects that I have worked on with the use of Unity
    Learn's free online tools and assests.</p>
  <h2>John Lemon's Haunted House</h2>
  <p>My first journey into Unity, this is a 3D microgame that taught me the basics of the Unity software. These basics involved 3D
    rendering, camera setup, and C# scripting. It is as simple as games come, with a clear goal, obstacles, and an ending that quits the
    program.</p>
  <p>The entire project was completed in roughly 6 hours, which should be the first insight into my work pace. Given the state of the world
    at the time of writing (April 2020), I hope to continue to work on this project to add my own small adjustments with the amount of free
    time I currently find myself having.</p>
