title: John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt
---

My first journey into Unity, this is a 3D microgame that taught me the basics of the Unity software. These basics involved 3D rendering, camera setup, and C# scripting. It is as simple as games come, with a clear goal, obstacles, and an ending that quits the program.

The entire project was completed in roughly 6 hours, which should be the first insight into my work pace. Given the state of the world at the time of writing (April 2020), I hope to continue to work on this project to add my own small adjustments with the amount of free time I currently find myself having.

The Git repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/JacquesBrangeon/JacquesBrangeon.github.io/tree/master/john_lemons_haunted_jaunt), and a download for the game will be available for both OSX and Windows once I've worked out how to do Git releases.
